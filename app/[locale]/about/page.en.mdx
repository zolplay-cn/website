# OK. Who are we?

It all started in 2021 with a simple and happy ideaâ€”making software should be fun! Zolplay began because we wanted to bring excitement, creativity, and joy back into making software. We noticed that the software world was becoming too serious, focusing mostly on money, numbers, strict rules, and buzz words like "AI." It felt less human, so we decided to change things up!

Our name, Zolplay, means <b>"assist to play"</b> in Chinese. It reminds us every day why we started: we wanted to mix fun with new ideas to create software people truly enjoy using. While others followed popular trends, we decided to do our own thing, making sure our work was always <Gradient>joyful, creative, and high-quality.</Gradient>

Our mission is not just to create another company, but to build a brand that people feel proud of. We want people to say with confidence, <b>"it's guaranteed quality when it's crafted by Zolplay".</b>
