# OK. Who are we?

<Balancer className='prose-p:mt-0'>
It all started in 2021 with a simple and happy idea—making software should be fun! Zolplay began because we wanted to bring excitement, creativity, and joy back into making software. We noticed that the software world was becoming too serious, focusing mostly on money, numbers, strict rules, and fancy words like "AI." It felt less human, so we decided to change things up!

Our name, Zolplay, means <b>"assist to play"</b> in Chinese. It reminds us every day why we started: we wanted to mix fun with new ideas to create software people truly enjoy using. While others followed popular trends, we decided to do our own thing, making sure our work was always <Gradient>joyful, creative, and high-quality.</Gradient>

Our founder, Cali, first wanted to help our clients build better SaaS, websites and whatnot. But soon, we found ourselves doing even more exciting things! We created podcasts 🎙️ to share our ideas, threw awesome pizza parties 🍕, organized fun Halloween costume events 🎃, and hosted cool meetups for developers in Shenzhen. We even started sending surprise gifts 🎁 to our friends and supporters. Later, we opened our own shop 🛍️, making fun clothes and items because <Red>it felt fun and right.</Red>

At Zolplay, we believe that community is very important. Every event we hold, every podcast we record, and every product we make helps us connect with others who love <b>great design and creativity.</b> We put a lot of care into everything we build, making sure it's something special that people really love and trust.

Our mission is not just to create another company, but to build a brand that people feel proud of. We want people to say with confidence, <b>"it's guaranteed quality when it's crafted by Zolplay".</b>
