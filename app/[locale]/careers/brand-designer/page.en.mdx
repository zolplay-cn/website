# Brand Designer

## About Zolplay

We’re an integrated design studio for founders with high standards. We align Brand, Product, and Growth—embedding with teams to ship work that feels true and moves the metric that matters.

## Why this role exists

Client demand is up. You’ll turn founder intent into identity, narrative, and assets that scale—from mark and type to motion and campaigns. Systems-minded, craft-obsessed, and comfortable moving from concept to production.

## How design works here

Async-first. Weekly cadence. Tight feedback. We work in Figma/FigJam, Slack, and Linear—shipping to Framer/Webflow/Next.js when needed. We sweat the details, document decisions, and measure outcomes.

## What you’ll own

* Identity systems: logo, typography, color, grids, and usage rules that scale.
* Brand toolkits: componentized templates for social, editorial, email, decks, and print.
* Motion and interaction language; lightweight guidelines that travel into product.
* Campaigns and moments: launches, announcements, events, and merch.
* Quality control: keep every touchpoint coherent while pushing the voice forward.

## Who you’ll work with

Founder (**Cali**, CEO), product designers, and client teams—aligning Brand ↔ Product ↔ Growth from first impression to in-product moments.

## Requirements

* 3+ years in brand/communication/visual design with shipped work.
* Portfolio showing typography, layout, hierarchy, and storytelling range.
* Systems thinker who builds reusable libraries and clear guidelines.
* Comfortable across static, interactive, and motion; strong art direction and hands-on craft.
* Clear writing; strong presentation; decisive taste.

## Nice-to-haves

* Illustration or 3D (Procreate/Spline/Blender).
* Framer/Webflow build or creative coding.
* Event branding, merch, or vendor production experience.
* Video/motion graphics; shader experimentation.

## Benefits

Competitive compensation, flexible PTO, remote-first, gear/software stipend, and a learning budget. Clear weekly cadence and embedded partnerships that value taste, speed, and outcomes.

1) Intro + Portfolio Walkthrough (40 min)
2) Live collaboration (60 min)
3) Team chat + closing conversation (30 min)
