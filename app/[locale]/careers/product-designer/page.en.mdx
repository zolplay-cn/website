# Product Designer

## About Zolplay

We’re an integrated design studio for founders with high standards. We align Brand, Product, and Growth—embedding with teams to ship work that feels true and moves the metric that matters.

## Why this role exists

Client demand is up. We need a hands-on product designer who ships with taste and speed—turning founder intent into interfaces, systems, and motion that convert.

## How design works here

Async-first. Weekly cadence. Tight feedback. We work in Figma/FigJam, Slack, and Linear—shipping to Framer/Webflow/Next.js when needed. We sweat the details, document decisions, and measure outcomes.

## What you’ll own

* End-to-end product flows (IA → wireframes → high-fidelity UI → micro-interactions).
* Design systems: tokens, components, accessibility (WCAG), documentation.
* Conversion surfaces: onboarding, pricing, dashboards, and key moments.
* Marketing handoff: brand → product → site—clean files, clear specs.
* Feedback loops and experiments—ship weekly across one or more client tracks.

## Who you’ll work with

Founder (**Cali**, CEO), engineers, and fellow designers—often sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with client teams.

## Requirements

* 3+ years designing shipped web/mobile products.
* Portfolio that shows systems thinking, crisp UI, and interaction craft.
* Fluency in Figma (libraries, variants, Auto Layout), accessibility, and handoff.
* Comfortable with motion and prototypes.
* Clear writing; strong presentation; decisive taste.

## Nice-to-haves

* Framer/Webflow build chops or design-for-code literacy (React, GSAP).
* Analytics awareness; knows how to tie design to outcomes.
* Experience across SaaS, AI, or fintech.

## Benefits

Competitive compensation, flexible PTO, remote-first, gear/software stipend, and a learning budget. Clear weekly cadence and embedded partnerships that value taste, speed, and outcomes.
