# ðŸ‘‹&nbsp; We are Zolplay

We are a crew of digital misfits on a mission to build <b>kick-ass</b> software. We focus on <b>quality</b> in everything we do. For us, every detail countsâ€”because quality isn't just about looking nice; <Red>it's about feeling right.</Red>

Our founder learned a lot from working with companies like <Gradient>Microsoft, Niantic, and Starbucks</Gradient>. We believe great design should be easy to use, beautiful, and inspiring. Our goal is always to make things simple and excellent.

Zolplay doesn't just make great softwareâ€”we also help new companies grow. We've worked with startups to help them get important funding, proving that thoughtful design can help good ideas become successful. Check out <Link href="/work">our work</Link>, and see for yourself.

We understand how hard it is to start something new. Whether you're a solo entrepreneur taking your first steps or an experienced team pushing toward the next big thing, we're here to help.

Our newest service, [Neuship](https://neuship.co), shows our love for great ideas. It's a design partner service made especially to <Green>help founders bring their best ideas to life.</Green>

We're not just building apps or websitesâ€”we're building <b>connections, dreams, and opportunities</b>. Let's build something amazing together, one thoughtfully crafted experience at a time.
