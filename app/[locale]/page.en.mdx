# ðŸ‘‹&nbsp; We are Zolplay

We are a crew of digital misfits on a mission to build <b>kick-ass</b> software. We focus on <b>quality</b> in everything we do. For us, every detail countsâ€”because quality isn't just about looking nice; it's about feeling right.

Our founder learned a lot from working with companies like <Gradient>Microsoft, Niantic, and Starbucks</Gradient>. Because of this, we believe great design should be easy to use, beautiful, and inspiring. Our goal is always to make things simple and excellent.

Zolplay doesn't just make great softwareâ€”we also help new companies grow. We've worked with startups to help them get important funding, proving that thoughtful design can help good ideas become successful.
