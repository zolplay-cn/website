# Built in public, together

We care deeply about building communities. That's why we hosted developer hangouts at select venues for people to **connect and inspire**. Lightning talks, live prototyping, and fun conversations that turn into collaborations the moment laptops closed.

<Gradient>Craft should feel good in your hands</Gradient>, we surprised our friends and supporters with limited swag
drops and even opened up a tiny merch shop stocked with clothes, bags and gadgets that are designed to be kept, not
tossed.
