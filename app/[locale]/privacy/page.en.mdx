> We collect as little personal data as possible. We use a single first‑party cookie for theme preference. We use PostHog for analytics (configured to be privacy‑respecting), Stripe for subscription payments, and Cal.com for scheduling.

**Who we are.** Zolplay LLC (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) operates the website at [https://zolplay.com/](https://zolplay.com/) (the “Site”) and any related services (collectively, the “Services”).

## 1) Information we collect

We aim to minimize collection. We collect:

**A. Information you provide**

* Contact details (name, email) when you inquire, subscribe, or book a call.
* Account details (if subscriptions/accounts are offered): display name, login email.
* Payment‑related info **handled by Stripe**: we do not receive or store full card numbers. We may receive limited billing metadata (e.g., last4, brand, expiration month/year, billing address/postal code, payment status).
* Project or support messages you send us.

**B. Information collected automatically**

* Device and usage information (pages viewed, referrers, approximate location by IP, timestamps). Collected via **PostHog** configured in a privacy‑respecting way (see §4).
* **Theme preference cookie** (first‑party) to remember your light/dark mode setting (see §3).

**C. Information from third parties**

* If you book time via **Cal.com**, we receive booking details (name, email, time zone, meeting notes) and calendar metadata necessary to schedule the meeting.

We do not knowingly collect sensitive categories of personal data.

## 2) How we use information

* Provide, operate, and improve the Site and Services.
* Communicate with you (e.g., confirmations, service messages, support).
* Process subscriptions and payments via Stripe.

## 4) Analytics (PostHog)

We use **PostHog** to understand aggregate usage and improve the Site. We configure PostHog with privacy in mind (e.g., cookieless mode / no cross‑site tracking; IP redaction or truncation; honoring Do‑Not‑Track where feasible). We do not use analytics for targeted advertising.

PostHog processes analytics data as our service provider. Depending on configuration, limited data (e.g., page views, events, page performance, approximate geolocation) may be collected. See their documentation for details about data handling and storage regions.

---

## 5) Payments (Stripe)

Subscriptions and payments are processed by **Stripe**. Stripe acts as our payment processor and may collect and process your payment information directly (card details, payment tokens, fraud signals). We do not store full card numbers or CVC. We receive limited billing metadata needed for receipts, accounting, and fraud prevention (see §1A above). Your use of Stripe is subject to Stripe’s terms and privacy practices.

---

## 6) Scheduling (Cal.com)

When you book a call, **Cal.com** collects booking details (name, email, time zone, meeting notes) and writes the event to our connected calendar. We receive your booking information and may follow up by email. Your use of Cal.com is subject to their terms and privacy practices.

---

## 7) Sharing of information

We do not sell your personal information.
We share information only with:

* **Service providers** acting on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, payment processing, scheduling, email delivery, security). They must process data solely per our instructions and under appropriate safeguards.
* **Professional advisors** (legal, accounting) under confidentiality.
* **Authorities** where required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.
* **Business transfers**: in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction. We will notify you if legally required.

---

## 8) International transfers

We may transfer, store, and process information in countries other than where you live. Where required, we use legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses to protect transfers. Vendors may offer regional hosting; we choose privacy‑respecting options where feasible.

---

## 9) Data retention

We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described here (e.g., while you maintain an account or subscription), to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. We then delete or anonymize data.

---

## 10) Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

* access, correct, or delete personal data;
* object to or restrict processing;
* data portability;
* withdraw consent where processing is based on consent;
* opt out of marketing communications.

**California (CPRA):** We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by CPRA, nor do we process sensitive personal information for inferring characteristics.

**EEA/UK/Switzerland:** You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. We encourage you to contact us first.

**How to exercise rights:** Email [contact@zolplay.com](mailto:contact@zolplay.com). We may request verification information to protect your account.

---

## 11) Security

We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and least‑privilege practices. No system is perfectly secure; we encourage you to use strong, unique passwords for any accounts associated with our Services.

---

## 12) Children’s privacy

Our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required by your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

## 13) Changes to this policy
