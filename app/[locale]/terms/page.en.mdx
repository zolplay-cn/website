*Effective date: 11 September 2025*

> Short version: Use the Site responsibly. Don’t abuse, scrape, or break the law. Certain features involve third‑party services (Stripe, Cal.com) governed by their own terms. We offer the Site “as is,” with limits on liability to the extent permitted by law.

These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of [https://zolplay.com/](https://zolplay.com/) and any related services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
