As a game development team, creating exceptional games faster is always the ultimate goal. But how do you ensure that your game meets the expectations of your players and is well-received in the market? The answer is by capturing, analyzing, and sharing player experiences. And Nexus is the only tool you need to achieve this goal.

### Security and Privacy

Built by game developers for game developers, Nexus is an end-to-end solution that drives all forms of feedback, research, and validation. With its secure and private livestreams, encrypted videos, and low-latency streaming from both desktop and mobile devices, Nexus ensures that only your team can view and analyze the recordings. This means that you can share player feedback and experiences without worrying about data breaches or leaks.
