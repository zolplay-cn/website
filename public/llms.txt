# Zolplay (Design Studio)

Zolplay is a design studio for people with high standards. Based in Shenzhen, China, building products, brands, and digital experiences since 2021.

We've been partnering with high‑standard founders to craft premium, results‑driven brands and digital products that feel true and move the needle.

Zolplay is not an agency. We're your design partner. Embedded, founder‑to‑founder, from concept to launch. We sweat the details so your brand feels right and your product ships right.

## [Services](https://zolplay.com/services)

We partner with visionary founders from zero to one—and beyond. We focus on the moments that move business forward—brand, product, and growth—shipping high‑standard work that lasts.

We’re an integrated design studio: doing the right things at the right time, owning outcomes from first impression to shipped product.

### Manifesto (summary)
- Design and speed are not opposites.
- Clarify goals, reduce noise, iterate quickly, and ship consistently.
- Every pixel, word, and interaction is accountable—to users, metrics, brand.
- AI made “built” easy; we make “built right” your advantage.
- Others ship features—we craft preference through clarity, emotion, and flow.

## [Monthly Subscription Pricing](https://zolplay.com/pricing)

We offer 3 monthly tiers—Creative Plus (10 hrs/week), Creative Pro (20 hrs/week), Creative Max(30 hrs/week)—so you can choose the pace and scale up anytime. We also support project‑based quotes via a discovery call.

Best next step: a quick discovery call to confirm fit, align on goals and timeline, and recommend the right plan—then get moving fast.

## [Work](https://zolplay.com/work)

We’re an integrated design studio built for what’s next. Tomorrow’s challenges aren’t “brand” or “product” or “marketing” problems; they’re the same problem at different zoom levels.

We operate as one system—Brand, Product, Growth—where identity sets the story, interfaces convert, and content carries it. Strategy to pixels to launch, under one roof and one standard.
